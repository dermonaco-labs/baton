description: Session completion protocol - the opposite of "takeoff". Use this skill whenever the user says "land", "/land", "land the plane", "land it", "let's land", "land this", "bring it in", "wrap it up", "land the plan", "land plane", "time to land", "ok land", "go ahead and land", or any variation that signals they want to finish, close out, ship, or wrap up the current session's work. Executes the full commit → push → PR → handoff checklist without asking. If the user's message contains "land" in the context of finishing work, invoke this skill — it is a keyword trigger, not an exact match.

# Land the Plane Protocol

The session completion counterpart to `/takeoff`. Where takeoff *starts* work by surfacing the backlog, `/land` *finishes* work by running the full commit → push → PR → handoff checklist.

## Trigger

Any variation of: `land`, `/land`, `land the plane`, `land it`, `let's land`, `land this`, `bring it in`, `wrap it up`, `land the plan`, `land plane`, `time to land`, `ok land`, `go ahead and land`.

**This is a keyword trigger, not an exact match.** If the user's message contains "land" in the context of finishing/wrapping up work, invoke this protocol. When in doubt, invoke it.

## Core principle

"Landing" means **commit, push, and create a PR** — it does **not** mean merge. A PR is how humans review agent work; no PR means no review means no trust. Never merge unless the user explicitly says "merge this PR".

Work is **not complete until `git push` succeeds**. If push fails, resolve and retry until it works. Do not stop at "ready to push when you are" — you must push.

## Execution

Run the checklist **in order, completely, without asking**. Each step is non-negotiable.

### Step 1: File remaining work

Review what was worked on this session. Capture anything that's unfinished, deferred, or follow-up so it doesn't vanish when the session closes.

- If the project has Backlog.md (a `backlog/` directory at repo root), create tasks for unfinished/follow-up work via the backlog CLI or `mcp__backlog__task_create`.
- Otherwise, gather remaining work into a short handoff list and surface it to the user at Step 10.

Skip silently if nothing remains.

### Step 2: Run quality gates (only if code changed this session)

Run the project's build and test commands. **Detect the stack first** — only run gates for toolchains the repo actually uses. A non-zero exit must halt the routine; never suffix gates with `|| true`.

```bash
# pnpm projects (preferred over npm when both lockfiles exist)
if [ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]; then
  pnpm build && pnpm lint
# Node / Next.js (npm)
elif [ -f package-lock.json ] || ([ -f package.json ] && [ ! -f pnpm-lock.yaml ] && [ ! -f yarn.lock ]); then
  npm run build && npm run lint
fi

# Python
if [ -f pyproject.toml ] || [ -f setup.py ] || [ -f requirements.txt ]; then
  pytest && ruff check .
fi

# Go
if [ -f go.mod ]; then
  go build ./... && go vet ./...
fi

# Rust
if [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then
  cargo build && cargo test
fi
```

If build or tests fail, **fix them before proceeding**. Do not skip this step. A broken build does not ship. Because the gates are no longer suffixed with `|| true`, a failure here will halt the routine — which is the point.

If no code changed (docs-only, config-only, planning-only sessions), skip quality gates and note that in the handoff.

### Step 3: Update task status (if project has task tracking)

Mirror Step 1's conditional + literal-command pattern so a fresh agent — one cold-loading the skill on a session where the user said "land it" — can mechanically follow the CLI shape rather than guessing it from prose:

```bash
if command -v backlog >/dev/null 2>&1 && [ -d backlog ]; then
  # Mark completed tasks as Done
  backlog task edit TASK-XYZ --status Done

  # Update in-progress tasks with implementation notes for the next session
  backlog task edit TASK-XYZ \
    --status "In Progress" \
    --notes "<one-line implementation context, commit refs, what's blocking>"
fi
```

Substitute the actual task IDs from this session. Skip silently when the `backlog` CLI is absent — the conditional guard covers projects without backlog tooling.

If the project uses `backlog_task_id` in plan frontmatter, ensure status reflects reality.

### Step 4: Commit all changes

Stage specific files — **never** `git add -A` or `git add .`. That risks pulling in `.env`, credentials, or large binaries.

```bash
git status                         # see what's outstanding
git add <specific-files>           # stage deliberately
git commit -m "<type>: <summary>"  # conventional commits (feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci)
```

If there are no changes, skip. Do not create empty commits.

### Step 5: PUSH TO REMOTE (MANDATORY)

Work is not complete until this step succeeds.

```bash
# confirm branch is not main/master — project hooks may block push to main anyway
branch=$(git branch --show-current)
# only rebase if this branch already tracks a remote — new branches have no upstream yet
if git rev-parse --verify "origin/$branch" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  git pull --rebase origin "$branch"
fi
git push -u origin "$branch"
git status                         # must show "up to date with origin"
```

If push fails (conflicts, hook rejection, branch protection), **resolve and retry** until it works. Do not hand off with unpushed commits.

### Step 6: Create or update the PR

A PR is the review artifact. Agent work without a PR has no trust surface.

`gh pr view` exits 0 for CLOSED and MERGED PRs as well as OPEN ones — so a bare `gh pr view` is unsafe as an "is there a PR?" check. Capture `state` explicitly and only treat `OPEN` as a usable existing PR; otherwise create a fresh one.

```bash
pr_state=$(gh pr view --json state -q .state 2>/dev/null || echo "NONE")
if [ "$pr_state" = "OPEN" ]; then
  # PR already exists and is open — nothing to do here, but you may want to refresh the body.
  :
else
  # No PR, or only a CLOSED/MERGED one is associated with this branch — create a fresh one.
  gh pr create --fill --web=false   # or craft a proper title + body
fi
```

When creating the PR body, summarize the **full branch** diff (not just the latest commit). Resolve the default branch dynamically — it's not always `main`:

```bash
default_branch=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')
# fallback if remote HEAD isn't set
if [ -z "$default_branch" ]; then
  default_branch=$(git rev-parse --verify origin/main >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "main" || echo "master")
fi
git log "origin/$default_branch..HEAD" --oneline
git diff "origin/$default_branch...HEAD" --stat
```

Include a test plan checklist in the body. Share the PR URL at handoff.

**Never merge the PR** unless the user explicitly says "merge this PR". Landing ≠ merging.

### Step 7: Clean up

```bash
git stash list                     # check for session-era stashes
# drop only stashes from this session; leave older ones alone
```

If working in a worktree:
- PR open/pending review: leave the worktree in place so review feedback can be addressed without re-cloning.
- Work merged or abandoned: remove the worktree (`git worktree remove <path>`) and delete its branch (`git branch -d <name>`).

### Step 8: Verify

Confirm a clean state:

```bash
git status                                # working tree clean (or only untracked)

# Verify nothing is unpushed. Detached HEAD is a genuinely different state where
# this check does not apply (non-fatal skip). But a normal branch with no
# upstream means the work was never pushed — that MUST fail the gate, not pass
# with a soft notice.
if branch="$(git branch --show-current)" && [ -n "$branch" ]; then
  if git rev-parse --verify --quiet "refs/remotes/origin/$branch" >/dev/null; then
    if [ -n "$(git log "origin/$branch..HEAD" --oneline)" ]; then
      echo "BLOCKED: unpushed commits on $branch — push before landing." >&2
      git log "origin/$branch..HEAD" --oneline
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "OK: all commits pushed to origin/$branch."
  else
    echo "BLOCKED: $branch has no origin/$branch upstream — push the branch before landing." >&2
    exit 1
  fi
else
  echo "(detached HEAD — not on a branch; unpushed-commits check skipped)"
fi
```

If the check reports BLOCKED (non-zero exit), loop back and push. Do not hand off
a dirty or unpushed tree. Detached HEAD is the one state that legitimately skips
the check — every branch state must be fully pushed before landing.

### Step 9: Capture session state

Persist a written record of the session so the next agent (or human) can resume with full context, not just the verbal handoff in Step 10.

If the project tracks sessions in `docs/sessions/`, `.sessions/`, or an equivalent directory, append a short note there. Otherwise drop a brief handoff into the repo's working notes (e.g., `docs/handoffs/<date>.md`) capturing: branch, PR URL, accomplished, next up, blockers.

Run unconditionally — even on docs-only or planning-only sessions. The note is cheap and the recovery value is high.

### Step 10: Hand off

Provide a concise summary for the next session:

- **Accomplished** — what shipped (with task IDs if applicable)
- **Next up** — what's queued (with task IDs if applicable)
- **Blockers / gotchas** — anything that tripped you up or is waiting on a decision
- **Branch** — current branch name
- **PR** — PR URL from Step 6

Keep it scannable. The next session (human or agent) should be able to take off from this handoff without re-reading the whole transcript.

### Step 11: Final banner

After the handoff summary, emit a single final line:

```
🛬 PLANE LANDED — NICE WORK
```

This **must** be the last line of output — no content after it, no code fence, no trailing heading. The banner is a **completion** marker, not a "we tried" marker: emit it only when the routine completes successfully (including the clean-tree / nothing-to-commit path where Step 5 is skipped because there's nothing to push). If `git push` never succeeds, a quality gate fails and halts the routine, or the PR step errors out and cannot be resolved, do **not** emit the banner.

## Critical rules

These are non-negotiable when `/land` is invoked:

- **NEVER stop before pushing.** Unpushed work is stranded work.
- **NEVER say "ready to push when you are."** You push. That is the job.
- **NEVER skip quality gates.** Broken code does not ship.
- **NEVER merge the PR** unless the user explicitly says "merge this PR".
- **NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .`.** Stage specific files.
- **NEVER bypass hooks** (`--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`) unless the user explicitly asks. If a hook fails, investigate and fix the root cause.
- If push fails, **resolve and retry** until it succeeds.
- **Always end successful landing output with the `🛬 PLANE LANDED — NICE WORK` banner line.** Do not emit the banner on failure paths (push failed, quality gate halted the routine, PR step errored out with no resolution).

## Project-specific considerations

Some repos have local conventions layered on top of this protocol — read `AGENTS.md` at the repo root for project-specific rules (e.g., branch protection, PR comment workflows, backlog linkage requirements). Project rules override these defaults where they conflict.
